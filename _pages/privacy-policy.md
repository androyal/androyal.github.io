# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy governs your use of all apps for mobile devices created under the developer name "Androyal" on Google Play Store or Abd alhameed Alhinbazly on Apple App Store. By using our applications, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.


### What information do we collect and how is it used?

We collect limited data necessary for app functionality and to enhance user experience. This includes:

- Device language and locale settings.
- Time zone and session start/stop times for analytics purposes.
- Network status (e.g., WiFi, cellular) for optimizing content delivery.

We do not collect or share advertising identifiers (such as IDFAs, IDFVs, or Advertising IDs) unless explicitly consented to by the user. Similarly, we do not share precise location data with third parties unless the user provides explicit consent.


### Integration with Apple Health:

Our app "NutriTracker & Calorie Counter" integrates with Apple Health for the purpose of writing nutrition information. This integration allows users to seamlessly sync their nutrition data with Apple Health to manage their dietary intake alongside other health data. Please note that our app will only write nutrition information to Apple Health and will not read any data from it.


### Our Policy Concerning Children:

We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. 


### In-App Purchases:

Our application may offer in-app purchases (IAP) for additional features or content. These purchases are handled directly through the app store platforms (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store), and we do not have access to your payment information. Any data collected during the purchase process is governed by the respective app store's privacy policies.


### Changes to this Policy:

Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be placed here and will supersede this version of our Policy. We will take reasonable steps to draw your attention to any changes in our Policy. We suggest that you read this document each time you use the app to ensure it still meets your approval.

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us through our [contact form](/contact-us){:target="_self"}.
