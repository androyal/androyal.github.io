- IP address
- Country code
- Device language
- Locale
- IDFAs, IDFVs, Advertising IDs
- Time zone, session start/stop time
- Network status (WiFi, etc.)
- Location Data: We may use demographic and geo-location information to ensure relevant advertising is presented within the Service. However, we will not share your current location with other users or partners.

You can stop all information collection by uninstalling the Application. Use the standard uninstall processes available on your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with information without consent, they should [contact us](/contact-us){:target="_self"}, and we will delete such information within a reasonable time.
